% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2018} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2018} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2018}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2018}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\icmltitlerunning{CS234: Reinforcement Learning Winter 2025 - Final Project Proposal}

% \begin{abstract}
% This document provides a basic paper template and submission guidelines.
% Abstracts must be a single paragraph, ideally between 4--6 sentences long.
% Gross violations will trigger corrections at the camera-ready phase.

\section{Background and Related Work}

% What is the problem that you will be investigating ? Why is it interesting ?
% What literature have you already surveyed or will be 
% examining to provide context and background ?

\section{Data}
% If relevant, what data, simulator or real world RL domain will you be looking at ? 
% If you are collecting new datasets, how do you plan to collect them ?

\section{Methods}
% What method, algorithm or theoretical analysis are you proposing ? 
% If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how ? 
% How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations ? 
% If you are addressing a theoretical question, how do you plan to make progress ?

\section{Evaluations}
% How will you evaluate your results ? 
% Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures) ? 
% Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or 
% compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests) ?




% % Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% probably should) include acknowledgements. In this case, please
% place such acknowledgements in an unnumbered section at the
% end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
% who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas,
% and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial
% support.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018. It was modified from a version from Dan Roy in
% 2017, which was based on a version from Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
